### Research
<pre>
My research is at the intersection of algebraic geometry (of flag varieties), combinatorics (of tableaux and polyhedral 
complexes) and representation theory (of finite dimensional Lie algebras). Currently, my main interest is in various
degenerations of flag varieties, whose study interlaces these topics and leads naturally to tropical and toric geometry.

My research is funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) under the grant: 
"Research Grants - Doctoral Programmes in Germany."
