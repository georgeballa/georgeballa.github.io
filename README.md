### Research
```
My research is at the intersection of algebraic geometry (of flag varieties), combinatorics (of tableaux and polytopes) and 
representation theory (of finite dimensional Lie algebras). 
I am also currently interested in tropical varieties arising from algebraic geometry (from flag varieties in particular).
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
