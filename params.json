Currently, my main interest is in various\r\ndegenerations of flag varieties, whose study interlaces these topics and leads naturally to tropical and toric geometry.\r\n\r\nMy research is funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) under the grant: \r\n\"Research Grants - Doctoral Programmes in Germany.\"\r\n\r\n[<a href =\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06362\"> Preprint</a>]: Symplectic PBW Tableaux and Degenerate Relations, July 2020.\r\n\r\nMaster Thesis: Toric degeneration and tropical geometry of the variety of planes (<a href =\"https://aims.edu.gh\"> AIMS Ghana</a> and <a href =\"https://www.imsp-benin.com/home/\"> IMSP Benin</a>).\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaintained by me.
