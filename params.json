Currently, my main interest is in various \r\ndegenerations of flag varieties, whose study interlaces these topics and leads naturally to tropical and \r\ntoric geometry.\r\n\r\nMy research is funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) \r\nunder the grant: \"Research Grants - Doctoral Programmes in Germany.\"\r\n\r\n[<a href =\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06362\"> Preprint</a>]: Symplectic PBW Tableaux and Degenerate Relations, \r\nJuly 2020.\r\n\r\nMaster Thesis: Toric degeneration and tropical geometry\r\nof the variety of planes (<a href =\"https://aims.edu.gh\"> AIMS Ghana</a> and <a href =\"https://www.imsp-benin.com/home/\"> IMSP Benin</a>).\r\n</pre>\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
